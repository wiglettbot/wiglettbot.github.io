          What is Wiglett?
        </h2>
        <div class="bubble">
          Wiglett is a Discord bot designed for Pokémon draft leagues. It handles your
          drafts, match submissions, and more!
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2>
          Why should I use Wiglett?
        </h2>
        <div class="bubble">
          Wiglett removes the vast majority of moderation work, making it much easier to run a
          draft league. With features like <b>/leavepick</b> and <b>/draftmod timer</b>, Wiglett makes drafts go much
          faster while updating the doc for you! And with <b>/submit</b>, you can submit matches with little to no effort.
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2>
          How do I set it up?
        </h2>
        <div class="bubble">
          It's simple! Invite the bot using the link above, and use <b>/guide</b> to get started.
          Alternatively, you can find a detailed setup guide using the link below.
          <noscript>However, it looks like you have JavaScript disabled, so you may not be able to access the guide :(</noscript>

          What else does it do?
        </h2>
        <div class="bubble">
          As part of its match submission capabilities, Wiglett has <b>/analyze</b> just like Porygon
          (except this one has better kill tracking, works with old gens, randbats, etc. and doesn't crash). There is also a cross-server
          economy system with Game Corner themed minigames (like Voltorb Flip)! More features, like being able to
          trade and battle within the bot, are in progress.

          Introduction
        </h2>
        <div class="bubble">
          Hello, and welcome to the Wiglett Setup Guide! This is a detailed resource on all of the options that
          Wiglett provides. If you just want brief instructions on how to get started, the <b>/guide</b> command should
          tell you everything you need to know. (And if you do need more help, you can always come back here!)
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          The goal of this guide is to set up the bot to automatically update your doc with picks while running the draft,
          and with match data (Standings, Kill Leader, etc.) when submitting games after the draft. If you only want one
          of these features, you can skip to the corresponding sections using the Contents section above.
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          To start, you need to link a doc to Wiglett. You have two options for this: first, we will cover the
          <b>doc template</b>, and then we will go over how to <b>link a custom doc</b>. Even if you have an existing
          doc, I would highly recommend reading the next section on the doc template, as it may save you some effort.
        </div><br>
        <h2 id="doc-template">
          Linking the Doc Template
        </h2>
        <div class="bubble">
          To get a link to the doc template, use <b>/doc template</b>. You can see the command being used below.
          Clicking the link will let you make a copy.
        </div><br>
        <div class="carousel">
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/slashmenudoc.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/doctemplate.jpg')">
          </div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          When the copy has been made, you will be greeted with a setup tab as seen below. All you have to do is click the Set Up Doc
          button. A window should appear where you need to accept some permissions - these are required for the script to edit the doc - 
          and create a form that will be linked to the doc (this is how Wiglett will send data). You can use the scrollbar on the image
          carousel below to see what accepting the permissions looks like. FYI the reason why it's complaining that the script isn't
          verified, has no privacy policy, etc. is because it's entirely attached to the copy, so <i>you</i> are the "developer" and have
          100% control over editing the script should you wish to.
        </div><br>
        <div class="carousel">
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/setuptab.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/auth1.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/auth2.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/auth3.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/auth4.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/authdone.jpg')">
          </div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          Then, wait for the script to complete. After that, you're done!... with the setup for Wiglett at least. The only required steps are
          putting team names on the Rosters tab (they will fill in everywhere else), and putting the point values on the WiglettDex tab.
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          Other recommended tasks at this point are adding the rules to the Rules tab, adding coach names, time zones and logos to Rosters, setting the number
          of weeks for the Schedule tab (you can randomize it after the draft), and changing the color of the doc. As you can see, the doc does most
          of the work for you.
        </div><br>
        <div class="carousel">
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/rosters1.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/rosters2.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/wiglettdex.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/schedule.jpg')">
          </div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          To link the doc to Wiglett, first make sure your doc is public. Next, use <b>/doc link</b>, and paste in the url as shown. Your doc will then be linked!
        </div><br>
        <div class="carousel">
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/doclink.jpg')">

        </div><br>
        <h2 id="custom-doc">
          Linking a Custom Doc
        </h2>
        <div class="bubble">
          If you completed the previous section with the doc template, you can skip to <a href="/?guide#rules">the next section</a>. But if you already
          have a doc which you would like to maintain, this is the section for you! I would like to emphasize that if you have no knowledge about Google Sheets
          formulas and you were just given a doc template by someone else, I would recommend switching to the Wiglett doc template. This section does
          <b>not</b> require complicated Google Sheets knowledge, but it is easier if you generally know what you are doing. For images, I will use the Smogon
          doc template as an example.
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          To start, make sure your doc is public. Then use the <b>/doc link</b> command, and paste in your doc url as shown.
          You will be asked whether you want to use the Wiglett Setup Wizard; select Yes, and click the link.
        </div><br>
        <div class="carousel">
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/doclink.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/wizprompt.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/wizlink.jpg')">
          </div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          Once you've pulled up the wizard, press ctrl-R (or click the Run button). If it's your first time using the wizard, you will have to accept some permissions
          as shown below. The script will then link a form to your doc which will allow Wiglett to communicate with it, and also add some tabs which parse the data
          sent by Wiglett. After the wizard has finished, repeat the previous step of pasting your doc url into the <b>/doc link</b> command (if you need the image for this again just scroll up).
        </div><br>
        <div class="carousel">
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/wizauth1.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/auth2.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/auth3.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/wizauth2.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/wizcomplete.jpg')">
          </div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          Now your doc is linked, but you will need to integrate the tabs that got added to your doc before starting the draft. First, go to the Wiglett tab and enter the points budget, number of players,
          and length of the draft. Next, go to WiglettDex and input the point values for the mons. If you have these stored elsewhere on the doc, you can use a formula to do this. Finally, reference your
          coach/team names and mons on the WiglettMatches tab (you can do this after the draft since it's only needed for /submit).
        </div><br>
        <div class="carousel">
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/drafttab.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/wiglettdex.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/matchtab.jpg')">
          </div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          After that, you will want to reference the data on your existing tabs. The Wiglett Setup Wizard has some sample formulas that you can use, so copy those if you want - otherwise
          I will explain things here. The draft will fill in on the Wiglett tab in B2:B, with the coach indexes already in column C. The WiglettMatches tab has Standings and Kill Leader data
          which you can reference directly on their respective tabs. Both of these will need to be sorted with the SORT formula. Below you can see some examples of how to integrate these tabs.
        </div><br>
        <div class="carousel">
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/rostersint.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/standingsint.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/killsint.jpg')">
          </div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          Note that for /submit to work properly, the mons on WiglettMatches should use the Showdown name scheme (e.g. Venusaur-Mega). If you need to convert the Smogon template name scheme
          (e.g. Mega Venusaur) to this, you can use the following formula:<br><b>
          =MAP(REFERENCE TO YOUR MONS; LAMBDA(a; IFS(REGEXMATCH(a; "^Mega .* .$"); INDEX(SPLIT(a; " "); 0; 2)&"-Mega-"&RIGHT(a; 1); REGEXMATCH(a; "Paldean Tauros"); "Tauros-Paldea-"&SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(a; "Paldean Tauros "; ""); "Paldean Tauros"; "Combat"); REGEXMATCH(a; "^[^I].*(n|a) "); LET(b; REGEXEXTRACT(a; "^.*? "); TRIM(SUBSTITUTE(a; b; "")&"-"&SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(b; "Hisuian"; "Hisui"); "ian"; ""); "an"; "a"))); TRUE; a)))
        </b></div><br>
        <h2 id="rules">
          Setting Rules
        </h2>
        <div class="bubble">
          Now that you've linked your doc, you're ready to start the draft! However, there are some things you can do before that, which I will cover in this section and the next. Here, we will
          discuss how you can use <b>/rule</b> to add more complex rules to your draft.
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          When you use <b>/rule</b>, there will be a dropdown menu with different options. You can view the current rules by selecting View Rules as shown below. By default, your draft has
          species clause on, and count passives + cut timer on skip off. You can toggle either of these by using the command with the corresponding option. Count passives
          determines whether passive kills are separated from direct kills when submitting matches, and cut timer on skip will halve a coach's timer if they are skipped by timer during the draft.
        </div><br>
        <div class="carousel">
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/rulesdropdown.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/viewrules.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/ruleshelp.jpg')">
          </div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          The other options use the data parameter of the command. For example, to delete the 4th rule (you can see the numbers in view rules), select delete rule and enter 4 into the data parameter. The min length
          rule allows for variable draft lengths - normally Wiglett will not allow coaches to run out of points early, so this rule lets you tell Wiglett the minimum number of mons that coaches
          need to draft. The megas rule restricts the number of mega evolutions coaches can draft to the number specified (specifically, it checks whether the mon's name includes "-Mega" or "Mega ").
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          The cap rule is the most versatile one. The data you enter must be formatted as: points min max, where points is a comma separated list of point values, min is the minimum number of mons
          that coaches must draft from these tiers, and max is the maximum that coaches can draft. For example, if I enter 18,19 1 2, coaches <i>must</i> draft at least 1 mon that costs 18 or 19, and
          <i>cannot</i> draft more than 2 mons from these tiers.
        </div><br>
        <div class="carousel">
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/caprule.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/rules.jpg')">
          </div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          If you have a tier-based league, this is the main way for you to enforce limits, as any non-numeric point values in WiglettDex will not subtract any points from coaches' totals. For example,
          if I assign mons to S, A, B, C, and D tiers, and I want coaches to draft 2 mons from each tier, then I would do one rule with S 2 2, one with A 2 2, so on and so forth. If you have a hybrid
          points and tiers league, you can give mons their numeric values in WiglettDex, and use cap rules to enforce the additional restrictions (e.g. one of each tier required).
        </div><br>
        <h2 id="divs">
          Creating Divisions
        </h2>
        <div class="bubble">
          If you only need one division, you can skip to <a href="/?guide#draft">starting the draft</a>. Otherwise, you can use the <b>/div</b> command as described in this section.
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          To add a division, use <b>/div create</b>. Then enter a name for the division in the name parameter. After using the command, you
          can see that a div has been added.
        </div><br>
        <div class="carousel">
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/divcreate.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/divcreateres.jpg')">
          </div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          When you have more than one division, most commands will now ask you which division you want to use the command for. For example, using <b>/div rename</b> or <b>/div delete</b> will give you a
          dropdown of all of the divisions. The command will rename or delete the division that you select.
        </div><br>
        <div class="carousel">
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/divdropdown.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/divrename.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/divdelete.jpg')">
          </div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          To set up this div, simply use <b>/doc link</b> to link another doc. Assuming you have already set up a doc in the previous steps, you can make a copy of that doc. However, before linking the doc,
          you will need to rerun the setup script to link a new form. If you used the doc template, a new menu item will appear as shown below (it's pretty hard to miss). If you have a custom doc, attempting
          to link a copy of your doc will send you to the Wiglett Setup Wizard as it did the first time. Running it will simply ensure that a form is properly linked, after which you can link the doc.
        </div><br>
        <div class="carousel">
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/docdropdown.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/fixformdesync.jpg')">
          </div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          Using <b>/rule</b>, <b>/draftmod</b>, and <b>/submit</b> will also give a dropdown if you have multiple divisions. If a coach is in multiple drafts at once, <b>/draft</b> and <b>/leavepick</b> will
          allow them to select a division.
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          If you need to have multiple divisions on the same doc, you should create a simple doc for each division to link to Wiglett, and reference the data on your actual doc using an IMPORTRANGE formula.
          An easy way to do this is to copy the Wiglett Doc Template, fill in the coaches, and copy over your point values.

          You've made it to the fun part! This section will explain how to use <b>/draftmod</b> to moderate the draft. <b>/draft</b> and <b>/leavepick</b> will also be discussed here, as these will be used
          by coaches during the draft. These commands are very self explanatory, but you can explain how to use them in an announcement, or give them the link to <a href="https://youtu.be/r5wZwTkfels">this video</a>.
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          To start the draft, use <b>/draftmod start</b>. You can then select a number of users <i>in draft order</i> corresponding to how many coaches are in the division. If the number you see is not
          correct, make sure that you set up your doc correctly. After selecting all of the users, click Start. Wiglett will ping the first coach, and the draft will begin!

        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          To draft a mon, coaches can use <b>/draft</b>. This will draft the mon, updating the doc and pinging the next person. If the pick is illegal for whatever reason, Wiglett will let them know why they cannot pick that mon.
          If they misspell the mon, there is a built-in autocorrect (because draft players cannot spell). However, if they <i>really</i> butcher the name, it will inform them that the pick is invalid.
        </div><br>

          </div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          The real magic lies in <b>/leavepick</b>. When it isn't their turn, coaches can leave picks which will automatically be drafted when it is their turn. Coaches can leave up to 2 picks, and a backup for each,
          by selecting the different options provided when using the command as seen below. If a pick gets sniped, the backup (if present and available) will be drafted instead; otherwise, the draft will wait for them
          as usual. They can also use <b>/leavepicktogglestrict</b>; this will make it so if they have left a next and following pick, the next pick will <i>not</i> be drafted if the following pick is sniped. This is
          useful if you want to draft a pair of mons, but not just one of them. 
        </div><br>

        <div class="bubble">
          Now for your job. There are a number of <b>/draftmod</b> commands that allow you to moderate the draft. <b>/draftmod pause</b> pauses the draft, preventing coaches from drafting. To unpause the draft, use <b>/draftmod start</b>.
          <b>/draftmod end</b> can be used to end the draft early. <b>/draftmod replace</b> allows you to replace a coach that is in the draft - select the coaches to swap as shown in the final image below, and then click Replace.
        </div><br>
        <div class="carousel">

        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          <b>/draftmod skip</b> skips the current coach, effectively drafting the --- placeholder for them. At any point afterwards, when that coach uses /draft, they can draft a make up pick. If they do not do so beforehand, 
          coaches will have to draft all make ups before their next pick. <b>/draftmod forcedraft</b>, rather than skipping, forces the current coach to draft a specified mon. This will bypass any point or rule restrictions in case
          you need to intentionally break the rules... so make sure it is intentional! However, this command will still only let you draft mons that are on the doc, so you don't have to worry about misspelling.

        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          <b>/draftmod timer</b> allows you to set a timer for the draft. Enter the number of minutes, and coaches will automatically be skipped if they do not pick before the time runs
          out. If <b>/rule</b> cut timer on skip is toggled on, a coach's future timer will be halved when they are skipped via timer. Turning off the rule mid draft will disable this. Note that
          pausing and unpausing the draft or changing the timer will not check timer cuts for the current pick.
        </div><br>

        <div class="bubble">
          If at any point you need to manually edit a draft pick, you can do so by editing the data in the (hidden) WiglettData tab on the doc. Simply ctrl-F for the mon, and replace it.

        <h2 id="submit">
          Submitting Matches
        </h2>
        <div class="bubble">
          For the final section, I will cover how to submit matches to the doc using <b>/submit</b>. If all you need is match stats from a replay, you can use <b>/analyze</b> to get these directly instead of submitting to the doc.
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          To submit a replay, use <b>/submit replay</b>, and paste the replay link into the command. You will see a preview
          of the match stats - if everything looks correct, click Submit. Then you should see the doc update with the match data.
        </div><br>
        <div class="carousel">
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/submitreplay.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/submitreplayres.jpg')">
          </div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          The other option is <b>/submit manual</b>. This is primarily intended for wifi leagues, which do not have replays. However, you can still
          add a replay to the replay parameter if you simply need to adjust stats before submitting them. (This will automatically be done if you do a replay submit, and Wiglett detects that there is a Zoroark
          or Zorua in the replay. This is because kills may not be correctly given if said mon gets a kill with Illusion active, and then switches out before the illusion is broken, as there is no other way to
          tell reliably via replay logs whether a mon is Zoroark if the illusion was never broken.) You can also use this command to input forfeit wins.
        </div><br>
        <div class="carousel">
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/submitmanual.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/submitmanual2.jpg')">
          </div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          After using the command, you will see a menu as shown in the images above. Select the winning and losing coach, and a differential option. Auto Diff is the best option for single games - differential
          will be calculated based on the deaths reported in the following stats. The 2-0 and 2-1 options are for best-of-3 sets, and 3-0 is for forfeit wins. If you need a different differential for a forfeit win,
          you can select this option and edit the differential later in WiglettData. After selecting a diff option, you will be able to select the mons that appeared in the match (for FFWs don't select
          anything and the match will be submitted immediately). 
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          Now it's time to enter your match data. Each mon will have buttons to increase or decrease kills and deaths (and passive kills if count passives is turned on). When the stats are correct, click Next to proceed
          to the next mon. On the final mon, clicking Next will submit the match.
        </div><br>
        <div class="carousel">
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/submitmanual3.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/submitmanual4.jpg')">
          </div>
          <div class="item" style="background-image: url('/img/submitmanual5.jpg')">
          </div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="bubble">
          If you need to change match data for any reason, edit the WiglettData tab on the doc. For example, if you made a mistake when submitting and need to resubmit, you can delete the row of the previously submitted
          match. Duplicate replay submissions won't be counted towards stats <i>unless</i> the analysis is different for whatever reason (i.e. count passives changed), but to be safe, try not to leave duplicate submissions.
